                There is a new drug available for children with uncontrolled asthma caused by airborne allergens. Xolair is already approved for people, ages 12 and older, with moderate to severe asthma. It belongs to a class of drugs called biologics. It is given in a doctor’s office by injection. The FDA recently approved it for children between ages 6 and 11 whose asthma is not controlled with other long-term medications . Approval makes Xolair the only biologic for children with uncontrolled allergic...</p>

                The latest research shows that there is no evidence of infection from allergy shots, also known as allergen immunotherapy. The threat of infection is one of the reasons cited in a proposal to restrict your access to allergy shots . In this study, researchers looked at the records of more than 3,000 patients from two large Massachusetts hospitals. The data spanned 10 years. Patients received over 130,000 shots. During that time, guess how many infections researchers traced back to the allergy...</p>

                What health issue did this study examine? Researchers are studying a potential new treatment option for moderate-to-severe eczema. The drug is called dupilumab. It belongs to a class of drugs known as biologics. Dupilumab is thought to work by blocking the inflammation that causes eczema, or atopic dermatitis. What do we know about this issue so far? There is no cure for eczema. In extreme cases, it can cause bleeding and infections, affect sleep, and hurt one’s quality of life. Current...</p>

                There is no cure for asthma or allergies, which is why research is so important. AAFA supports research that will lead to better care, more effective treatments and, one day, a cure. Since May is Asthma and Allergy Awareness Month, it’s the perfect time to spotlight health research and how it can help those with asthma and allergies. On Friday, May 13, AAFA is co-sponsoring a Congressional briefing , From Discovery to Delivery: Research at Work Against Allergies and Asthma . The briefing...</p>

                What health issue did the study examine? Families who leave a hospital with prescriptions for asthma medicine sometimes do not fill them. That can cause return trips to the emergency room for treatment. What do we know about this issue so far? Some families have trouble filling prescriptions after a hospital visit because of a lack of transportation, time or health insurance. Some hospitals have given patients medicine before they leave in an effort to reduce the number of return visits and...</p>
